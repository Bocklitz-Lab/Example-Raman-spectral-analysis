# Example-Raman-spectral-analysis

Can be used as example for a data analysis workflow as suggested by Guo et al "Tutorial on Chemometric Analysis in Raman Spectroscopy: from Experimental Design to Machine Learning based Modelling". It also generates all the images related to the mice dataset in the publication.

While the Script "Analysis_code.R" contains the analysis code for thze example data, the file "function_definitions.R" contains the functions definitions.
